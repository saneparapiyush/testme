1. How does a Xamarin App work in iOS?

	Use your native code(Obejective C) and UI also with xamarin
	Code in c#
	See Architecture

	– Architecture:

		User Interface
		Application Layer 
		-	iOS                                                 


		Bussiness layer
		Data Access Layer
		Data Layer
		-	Core Library 



		• User Interface - The screens, controls and data presentation code. In Xamarin.iOS these classes are wrappers around the iOS CocoaTouch frameworks. The user interface that you build looks, feels and performs like a native Objective-C application.
		
		• App Layer - Custom classes to bind the business layer to the user interface, typically requiring platform specific features.

		• Business Layer - Business object classes and business logic.
		
		• Data Access Layer - Abstraction layer between the business logic and the data layer.

		• Data Layer - Low-level data persistence and retrieval; the Tasky sample uses a SQLite database binding.



2. Is it faster then JS frameworks like Cordova and RectNative, if so than Why?

	- Cordova based Hybrid app development - Target all Platform but its not native.
	- Mobile app development in React Native - Target iPhone and Android both, Native Behaviour. 
	- App development using Xamarin - Target iPhone , Android and Windows also, Native Behaviour. 

3. What setup is required to start development ?
	XCode,
	Xamarine Studio.

4. What is the overall process of development and deployment ? Is there any licensing involved

	For Distribute:

	https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/app_distribution/app-store-distribution/publishing_to_the_app_store/

	Follow Process and create .ipa file - Create archive from xamarine studio
	then open xcode -> Windows -> organizer and upload to appstore 

	For Development:

	- C#
	- For design XAMARINE Studio Or Xcode

5. When to use and when not to use Xamarin. With Examples

	When to use:
	When we Target Many platform like iPhone, android, and windows
	One developer developed application in various platform and code reusabe

	When not use:
	When we Target Single platform like iPhone or android or windows
